        Look who's ruling the crib and the living room with that boss-baby vibe. Lounging back with the cool composure
        of a pint-sized playmaker, this little champ is rocking that swaddled swag. Decked out in a snazzy grey onesie
        with bold yellow crowns, it's clear who's the tiny trendsetter of the playpen scene. They're not just about nap
        time; they're about playtime, power moves, and calling the shots in the world of rattles and rhymes. It's clear
        who's got the real juice in the houseâ€”this babe's got a coo with more groove than a jazzman's blues.
